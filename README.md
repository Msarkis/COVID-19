# COVID-19
Data and analysis related to COVID-19.

NYTimes List of 1,000 names of people who died from COVID-19: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/reader-center/coronavirus-new-york-times-front-page.html. Thanks to https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/05/24/us-deaths-near-an/ for transcribing the data, which was then cleaned and turned into .csv. 

If you use any of the data, please let me know: msarkis@gmail.com.

NOTE: I did my best to guess whether a name was someone's last name or middle name. In case of error, let me know!
